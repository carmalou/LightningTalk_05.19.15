# Introduction

???
I'm Carmen, I work at WDT, you can find me on Twitter/Github, blahblahblah

---
class: center, middle

# About my app

???
My app was designed specifically for some elementary students in Putnam City. This school is underprivileged and is one of the poorest schools in the district.
---
class: center, middle

# Lots of debate

???
While planning for this presentation, I did some looking around for something "official"...
???
There is an official stance, but also a lot of debate

---
class: center, middle

# The "official" six-step plan

---
class: left, middle

1. Analyze the problem
2. Design the program
3. Code the program
4. Test and debug the program
5. Formalize the solution
6. Maintain the program

???
This seems pretty verbose to me. There was a lot of debate when I was researching about whether or not this was the proper way. Even some people advocating writing out your entire program before typing it.

# What you should REALLY do

---
class: center, middle

# What you'll need to get started

---
class: left, middle

* Computer with internet
* Browser (ideally Google Chrome)
* Text editor (Sublime, Atom, Brackets, TextWrangler)
* An idea
* A PLAN!

---
class: center, middle

# WHAT exactly are you TRYING to do?

???
Drill down the plan. Solving world hunger is NOT a plan. smaller and simpler, guys

---
class: center, middle

I wanted to build **an app** to help **underprivileged kids** get **started in tech** so they wouldn't be so **scared later**.<br />
But that's waaaaaay too big to go into one app.

???
Teach them the BASICS of HTML to get them started. Use 1 video, 2 games, and a glossary.

# HOW exactly are you GOING to do it?

---
class: center, middle

### This is normally where your sketching skills would come in handy.

???
A lot of people want you to sketch out what your user is going to do, vs what the computer will give back. I like to just use pseudocode. Some people like to just jump in and start coding. If you are new this might be the best approach just to get in there and get started, as opposed to milling around and trying to figure things out. Though ultimately this is going to be up to you.

# Special Considerations

---
class: left, middle

Things you'll want to consider:

1. Who is your user?
2. How are they accessing your product?
3. What browser are they using?
4. What is their technical ability?
5. Is there a specific language you want/need to use?
6. What problem are you trying to solve with this?
7. Can this be done in a simpler way?

???
If you are working with a customer or client, No. 6 is a very important question. In my experience clients frequently try to solve their problem in what is perhaps a more complicated way than necessary. If they are making what seem like crazy requests, ask them what problem they are trying to solve.

???
Just to give you an idea, a few considerations I made for my app were that these kids don't have internet or a computer at home. They have iPads in the classroom, and at home usually someone has a smart phone with some sort of data plan. So I knew a website was out, but an app would probably do the trick. It needed to be on the App Store and Google Play store (remember the ipads in the classroom?) and it needed to be small since it was going on a phone. Ideally it needed to also run without wifi or data.

# Now for the fun part!

???
This is where you would get started actually coding, once you have figured out what you are doing and have a pretty good plan in mind, and have taken any special considerations into account.

---
class: center, middle

# Testing.... 1, 2, 3

???
Testing is so incredibly important, I really can't stress it enough. It's really important not to just test your app as you intend for it to be used, but also how a user might use it. (even if it doesn't make any sense to use it that way!) That is how you're going to expose the most serious bugs.

# Things you probably should be doing, but may not be doing....

---
class: left, middle
* Documenting your code
* Commenting your code
* Having others test and review your code
* Having other non-devs test your product

???
Documenting your code can be as simple as a readme on github just to let people know what your code is all about.
???
I rarely comment my code as I go, and that is something I should really do. I tend to try to give my variables specific names that I think I'll understand later. This is NOT the best way to go. Do your future-self a favor and comment your code so that when you come back later you understand what you were working on.
???
Having a fresh set of eyes look at your code when you are having issues can be a life-saver. But it's important to review your code when you aren't having issues as well. Getting a second opinion can simplify your code, and it can also teach you something new, which is cool
???
Having non-devs test your code gives you an idea of what a user might do. Ideally this would be a test user -- someone whom you are targeting your app toward. This will give you all sorts of good information, like if things are easy to find, if the app flows well, and how they will use it. (remember when I said to test it how a user would actually try to use it. well here you go!)

# My Project

???
I'd like to talk just briefly about the project I've been working on, and show you guys some pictures. I was out at the school testing yesterday with the kids, and they had a great time.
